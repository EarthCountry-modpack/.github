# EarthCountry Modpack 

EarthCountry is a multiplayer modpack for Minecraft created to play with our friends on a pseudo-political server It was tech based and the server was hosted with an Earth terrain recreation map (EarthCountry V1)

Today, it's the same as before, but updated The V2.4, named Aetheria Politics, is now with mod modifications (through KubeJS and recipe manipulation inside the .jar when necessary)
